\textbf{Module Type Objects:} % Is this even useful
Built a parellel object system using modules as the core components in python to allow for more flexible and better controlled attribiutes.

% 1.             What does it solve or fix?                %
% 2.          What skills does it demonstrate?             %
% 3.         Does it use show novel techniques?            %
% 4.    Does it use any advanced mathematical tools?       %
% 5.     Does it implement any novel optimisations?        %
% 6.     Does it require any extra work or changes?        %

% Don't even know if this was useful or a dead-end, need to characterise performance gains


% 1. Inconvient language restrictions in python 
% 2. Deep understanding of the python language, underlying CPython low-level implementations
% 3. Using modules as a parallel object system
% 4. **NO*
% 5. Potentially significantly lower overhead for processing objects
% 6. **Important, time efficiency characterisations**, finalise + publish
