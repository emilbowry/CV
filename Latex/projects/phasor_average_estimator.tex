\textbf{Phasor Average Estimator}:
\ifattr{math_based}{
A Non-parametric, Recursive Bayesian Estimator that modelled event streams as a superposition of phasors, enabling Zero-Lag estimation. It allows us to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Filter noise and jitter, via phase interference without requiring evidence accumulation windows.
	\item Normalise likelihoods via magnitude-weighted Phase Coherence, utilising the Triangle Inequality to guarantee a probability space $\in [0,1]$ regardless of amplitude variance.
	\item Eliminate arbitrary exogenous hyperparameters via these natural geometric bounds.
\end{itemize}}{
Developed a scale-invariant, Phasor-based Statistical Model to solve hardware jitter and Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI), in a Molecular Communication system. It provided zero-lag estimation, unlike moving averages; retained phase information, unlike mixture models; and provided a non-parameteric way to estimate state.
