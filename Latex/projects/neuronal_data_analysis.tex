\textbf{Neural Data Analysis:}  % BE MORE SPECIFIC
Built a simulation framework for simulating Lateral Intraparietal Cortex (LIP) neurons. The core objective was to evaluate and test different statistical models for neuron impulses.
The framework included:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Utilised Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) as a model for Neuron Impulses `step/ramp models'
	\item Assesed HMM approximations of the SDEs
	\item Developed a ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for scientific data, instead of directly using the lab's given methods.
	\item Used Baysian Inference to fit model parameters, and quantify model mismatch and brittleness.
\end{itemize}

% note the ETL and analysis directly influenced the creation of my plotting tool

% 1.             What does it solve or fix?                %
% 2.          What skills does it demonstrate?             %
% 3.         Does it use show novel techniques?            %
% 4.    Does it use any advanced mathematical tools?       %
% 5.     Does it implement any novel optimisations?        %
% 6.     Does it require any extra work or changes?        %

% 3. **Plotting** but that was formalised in my plotting library

% 4.a Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs): (Implied if simulating diffusion/ramp models).
% 4.b Point Processes: Modeling spike trains (Poisson processes).


% 5. Caching simulations (not novel), potentially integrate module-type data, data structure manipulation to prevent recomputing differnet "views" of the same fundamental data

% 6. Finalise + publish results
