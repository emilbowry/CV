\textbf{iCloud Find-my messaging service:} 
A system to piggyback on Apple's ``Find my iPhone'' API to remotely communicate between devices without knowledge of any identifiers like IP addresses (Side-Channel Analysis).
% This involved reverse engineering the protocol to analyse packet payloads/and database structures without documentation.
