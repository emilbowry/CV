\textbf{Automated Notes Reasoning:} % Explore the category theory relation, ensure it is concrete `https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.09375`
A system that makes inferences about my course notes, given a particular grammar for the note titles. By utilising a common grammar of note titles to be able to define relationships, and types of notes to be able to build higher order structures and relationships between topics and individual notes.
It could identify where I had missed notes, graph connections between notes, understand the relationships between concepts.%, and leveraged tools from category and graph theory.

The implementation necessitated reverse engineering parts of the `Obsidian Markdown Editor', in order to have a better integration than was offered in the public API and documentation. % Is this illegal?
