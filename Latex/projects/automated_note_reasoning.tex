\textbf{Automated Notes Reasoning:} 
\ifattr{math_based}{
A knowledge graph inference engine.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Enforced Universal Properties (Categorical Products) to programmatically identify missing intersectional nodes between disjoint topics, automatically generating bridging notes.
    \item Modelled the relationship between Syntax and Semantics as an Adjunction (Galois Connection), guaranteeing that every grammatical title maps to a logical object.
    \item Applied the Yoneda Lemma to classify notes solely via their morphisms to specific `Type Functors' (Definitions, Equations), enabling property inference without content parsing.
\end{itemize}
