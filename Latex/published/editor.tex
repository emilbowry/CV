A fork of Microsoft VSCode that:
\begin{itemize} 
        \item Removes all telemetry pipelines at the source, rather than no-opping the endpoints like the `Codium' alternative.
        \item Removes LLM integrations and bloat.
        \item Added new features, like a persistent homepage, and cross-codebase note taking system
\end{itemize}
