A fork of Microsoft VSCode that:
\begin{itemize} 
        \item Removes all telemetry pipelines at the source, rather than no-opping the endpoints like the `Codium' alternative.
        \item Removes LLM integrations and bloat.
        \item Added new features, like a persistent homepage, and cross-codebase note taking system
\end{itemize}

% 1. Telemetry issues, software bloat and privacy
% 1.b Supply Chain Security, emoving telemetry "at the source" rather than just blocking the URL (network level), you guarantee that data never leaves the memory buffer.

% 2. 
%     - Adapting to **massive**  professional code-base in order to make direct, and targetted modifications, as well as large scale modifications
%     - Undestanding of CI/CD pipelines (useful relation to my own development of one for AI compatible web stuff)
%     - Comprimising to version lock in and future api issues
%     - Build System management: Compiling complex Electron apps from source
%     - Privacy Engineering: Auditing code for data exfiltration points.

% - Brownfield Development: The ability to navigate, understand, and modify a massive, undocumented, and foreign codebase (Microsoft VSCode) without causing regression errors.
% -  Identifing and surgically removing deeply coupled subsystems (Telemetry/LLMs) without crashing the application. This requires tracing execution paths across thousands of files.
% - API Design & Shimming: "Rectifying internal APIs" writing Interface Adapters. When i removed a subsystem, i had to create dummy interfaces or valid return states so dependent modules wouldn't panic—a critical skill for maintaining system stability.
% - Polyglot Adaptability: Learning a new language (TypeScript/Electron framework) by reading production-grade code rather than tutorials.
% 3. **NO**

% 4. **NO**

% 5. **NO**

% 6. Readme, qualitively explain changes, build criteria etc
