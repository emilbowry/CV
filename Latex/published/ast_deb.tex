% 2.          What skills does it demonstrate?             %
% 3.         Does it use show novel techniques?            %
% 4.    Does it use any advanced mathematical tools?       %
% 5.     Does it implement any novel optimisations?        %
% 6.     Does it require any extra work or changes?        %

% 1. Saves time for development and testing

% 2.a Advanced python manipulation
% 2.b Compiler Theory: Understanding Abstract Syntax Trees and Visitor patterns.
% 2.c Instrumentation: Injecting observability into code at runtime (similar to how high-frequency trading platforms profile code).
% 3. Uses AST to manipulate source code for JIT execution

% 4. **NO**

% 5. Potentially, will have to reread the source

% 6. Finalise and clean up code
