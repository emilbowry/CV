% 1. Saves time for development and testing

% 2.a Advanced Python manipulation
% 2.b Compiler Theory: Understanding Abstract Syntax Trees and Visitor patterns.
% 2.c Instrumentation: Injecting observability into code at runtime (similar to how high-frequency trading platforms profile code).
% 3. Uses AST to manipulate source code for JIT execution

% 4. **NO**

% 5. Potentially, will have to reread the source

% 6. Finalise and clean up code
