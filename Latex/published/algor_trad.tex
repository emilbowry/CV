A teaching resource that develops and implements knowledge gained in my signals processing, statistics, systems and other engineering courses, as well as other information I learnt from Dexter's Notes of the Mathematics Tripos.
This includes appllications of:
\begin{itemize} 
        \item Analysis tools like: K-means clustering, linear regression
        \item Stastical tests like Augmented Dicky-Fuller, Variance Ratio, Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity, and Stationarity Analysis
        \item Signal Processing techniques including Fourier, Wavelet and Hilbert transforms, continuous and discrete filters.
        \item Optimisation techniques, it covers: linear programming, non-linear programming and convex optimisation
        \item Other general tools like PCA, semantic analysis, HMMs and inference tools,  Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm
\end{itemize}
