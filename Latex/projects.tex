\section{Projects and Additional Experience}
\par
\textbf{Phasor Average Estimator}:
Developed a scale-invariant, Phasor-based Statistical Model to solve hardware jitter and Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI), in a Molecular Communication system.
\par
\textbf{Neural Data Analysis:}
Built a simulation system for Lateral Intraparietal Cortex (LIP) neurons to evaluate and test different statistical models for neuron impulses.  Used tools, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Peri-Stimulus Time Histogram (PSTH), Fano-Factor. Used Bayesian Inference to evaluate model brittleness and mismatch.
\par
\textbf{Integrated Design Project:}
Group Project building a self-navigating robot -- my contributions to the software led us to coming 2nd place in a University wide robotics competition.
