            \item Analysed new business opportunities and ventures, writing insight articles.
        }
        \item Led skill days, which taught developers the low-level networking implementations of the tools they use: \small\url{https://github.com/emilbowry/NetworkProgrammingLesson} 
        \item Organised the weekly cyber-security brief about emerging threats and vulnerabilities.

% 1. `Anomaly detection`: Hard to determine statistic for a large dataset of vehicals

% 2.a `Anomaly detection`: Self taught machine learning techniques (hadn't been covered in courses yet)
%     - Forensic Data Analysis: Identifying patterns in noisy, real-world data (fuel logs).
% 2.b `Skill days`: Competancy to teach senior developers skills while being an intern
% 2.c `Cyber-security': Awareness to big-picture security issues and external factors in software development

% 3. **NO**

% 4.a Statistical methods and Supervised machine learning algorithm (not really that advanced)
% 4.b Time-Series Analysis: Assuming fuel theft detection involved looking for deviations from seasonality or expected consumption curves (Regression residuals).
% 5. **NO**
