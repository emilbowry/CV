% add background generator snippet

% - Geometric (Clifford) Algebra: Utilised in the high-dimensional embedding space to treat semantic relationships as multivectors rather than simple vectors. This allows for:
%     - Rotor-based transformations: Modeling semantic shifts (e.g., negation or context changes) as rotations on the n-dimensional manifold rather than simple translations.
%     - Bivector Analysis: Measuring the "area" or deviation between semantic vectors to capture nuanced differences that scalar metrics (like Cosine Similarity) miss.
