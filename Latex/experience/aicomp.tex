    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Developing an automated privacy policy analysis model, this included:}
        \begin{itemize} 
            \item Utilises Large Language Models for initial data extraction:  Defining the output form using an OpenAPI schema object for consistently returned format for processing.
            \item Improving and refining the Hader et al's methodology [DOI: 10.1007/s00607-024-01331-9] for a generative, and automatable process to gain more nuanced insight into privacy policy and reduce the amount of API calls.
            % Ensure Below Is Correct
            \item Unsupervised semantic equivalence detection model utilises Baysian Inference, Topology, Linear Algebra, NLP techniques and Non-linear Systems analysis. Part of my system derived an analog for Random k Conditional Nearest Neighbours, a recently published technique for the classification of high-dimensional data.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Redeveloping full-stack website:}
        \begin{itemize} 
            \item Defining a PDF creation system that composes PDF document directly a set of data/json using the PDF `page description language'. % More precise
            \item Generalising CSSTypes (Typescript) to be able to create more complex, type-safe style objects.
            \item Creating a geometry engine to compose mathematically definable UI styles, including the capability to have seamless non-uniform backgrounds over disconnected, and unconventionally shaped UI components. % More precise
            \item Simulating a toroidal topology for a scroll-bar to define well ordered cyclical UI wheel elements.  % Explain what this means
            \item Dynamic Background Image generator: Efficiently creates tileable background images on the clientside without the need for image processing tools.
            \item Managing databases with Prisma, PostgreSQL, mongoDB.
            \item Handling authentication, payment processing and third-party APIs.
            \item Hit metadata analysis engine, creates interaction based profiles utilising site-entry points, device and location data to profile and analyse site interactions. % More precise
        \end{itemize}
        \item Managing cloud infrastructure, including virtual machines and networking.% Whats the point
    \end{itemize}
