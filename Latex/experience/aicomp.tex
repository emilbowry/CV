    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Developing an automated privacy policy analysis model, this included:}
        \begin{itemize} 
            \item Utilises Large Language Models for initial data extraction:  Defining the output form using an OpenAPI schema object for consistently returned format for processing.
            \item Improving and refining the Hader et al's methodology [DOI: 10.1007/s00607-024-01331-9] for a generative, and automatable process to gain more nuanced insight into privacy policy and reduce the amount of API calls.
            \item Unsupervised semantic equivalence detection model utilises Baysian Inference, Topology, Linear Algebra, NLP techniques and Non-linear Systems analysis. Part of my system derived an analog for Random k Conditional Nearest Neighbours, a recently published technique for the classification of high-dimensional data.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Redeveloping full-stack website:}
        \begin{itemize} 
            \item Defining a PDF creation system that composes PDF document directly a set of data/json using the PDF `page description language'. % More precise
            \item Generalising CSSTypes (Typescript) to be able to create more complex, type-safe style objects.
            \item Creating a geometry engine to compose mathematically definable UI styles, including the capability to have seamless non-uniform backgrounds over disconnected, and unconventionally shaped UI components. % More precise
            \item Simulating a toroidal topology for a scroll-bar to define well ordered cyclical UI wheel elements.  % Explain what this means
            \item Dynamic Background Image generator: Efficiently creates tileable background images on the clientside without the need for image processing tools.
            \item Managing databases with Prisma, PostgreSQL, mongoDB.
            \item Handling authentication, payment processing and third-party APIs.
            \item Hit metadata analysis engine, creates interaction based profiles utilising site-entry points, device and location data to profile and analyse site interactions. % More precise
        \end{itemize}
        \item Managing cloud infrastructure, including virtual machines and networking.% Whats the point

% **Regulatory Analysis Engine:**
% -  Uses Generative AI, the correct and contemporary tool instead of NLP for core data extraction
% -  Adapts and improves on academic research
% -  **Unsupervised Machine Learning pipeline**
%     -  Implements Baysian Inference **core skill for quant jobs**
%     -  Uses novel techniques like Suprathreshold Stochastic Resonance (SSR), Topology

% **Web Development**
% - Learnt an entire new tool chain, and languages (React, Typescript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, mongoDB)
% - **Advanced styling manipulation**
%     - *Explain what skills this shows**
%     - Generative wall algorithm
%     - Uses non-trivial styling for front-end (the entire web is based of rectangular containers, this uses complex hexagonal geometry):
%         - Had to build a robust, mathematically derived styling engine `https://github.com/emilbowry/AICompWeb/blob/main/client/src/components/hexagons/hexagon-grid/honeycomb/HexagonRow.styles.ts`
%         - Had to directly monkey-patch a chrome bug `https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40918981#c_ts1687982181`
%         - Improves `https://github.com/frenic/csstype` to allow for more complex styling object vocabulary using advanced typing of (Typescript, the brand new programming language I learnt):
%                 - `https://github.com/emilbowry/AICompWeb/blob/main/client/src/utils/styles.types.ts`
%         - Created a dynamic background image generator to programmatically generate complex, "tilable" background textures entirely on the client-side
%         - Simulating a "euclidian torus" topology to allow for infinite scrolling, **apple doesnt do this** `https://uxdesign.cc/how-apple-fooled-users-with-fake-infinite-scroll-03fed32b112d`
%             - *probably a reason for that that i havent worked out but eh*
%             - *unsure if it is strictly a euclidean torus or just the standard donut torus*
%         - CSS Injection to handle high-performance highlighting, prevent re-rendering by modifying css rules and not the elements
% - **Utilities**
%     - PDF generator that implements the `ISO 32000' PDF specification to generate pdfs from java  objects or json
%     - Contextual telemetry analysis, creates interaction based profiles utilising site-entry points, device and location data to profile user events.
% - **Backend Stuff**
%     - Devising and prototyping a HTTP server from scratch using Rust
%     - Learning `express.js`' to create a production ready HTTP server after I re-learnt the low-level fundamentals
%     - Managing cloud infrastructure, including virtual machines and networking. *Needs to be more specific, since this is a common requirement, maybe experiment using `kubernetes'
% - **Other key skills to later implement**
%     - Directly implement a CI/CD pipeline from scratch
%     - kubernetes
%     - break down exact example and test scripts from engine into ipynb to demonstrate the specific techniques, currently it is an un-understandable mess of spagetti code and versions from initial testing
%     - publish front-end code

% - Geometric (Clifford) Algebra: Utilised in the high-dimensional embedding space to treat semantic relationships as multivectors rather than simple vectors. This allows for:
%     - Rotor-based transformations: Modeling semantic shifts (e.g., negation or context changes) as rotations on the n-dimensional manifold rather than simple translations.
%     - Bivector Analysis: Measuring the "area" or deviation between semantic vectors to capture nuanced differences that scalar metrics (like Cosine Similarity) miss.
